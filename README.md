# WEEK01-ASSIGNMENT
week 1 - first webpage
This assignment’s user stories are as follows:

    🐿️ As a user, I want the web page to have a clear structure with a recognisable header, footer, and navigation sections, so that I can easily navigate and understand the content.
    🐿️ As a user, I want the layout and navigation links to be responsive and well-organised, so that I can easily access and interact with the website.
    🐿️ As a user, I want to see text overlaid on images or other elements in a visually appealing way, so that the content is engaging and enhances my browsing experience.
    🐿️ As a user, I want images to load correctly and be displayed properly on the web page, so that my viewing experience is seamless and visually pleasing.

Requirements

    🎯 Ensure each section of the webpage is wrapped in the correct semantic tags, ensuring that includes a <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.
    🎯 Implement CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image or another element.
    🎯 Utilise CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the <nav> element.
    🎯 Ensure all image elements (<img>) and background images are correctly implemented with accurate file paths.

REFLECTION

-------------------------------------------------------------

    I believe that I have achieved all of the requirements.

REFERENCES

    I used both W3 Schools and MDN for references on positioning and flexbox. I struggle to remember all of the flexbox rules and what each one does. I have never had the need to position something using relative/absolute but now understand it.

    I made use of Google Ai to write the 'pigs might fly' explanation.

    I originally made the header 'fixed' but realised that any following code would be hidden beneath. I added a margin to compensate but as I understand, with a responsive page there may be a time when the h1 text size could change and affect the height of the header making it possible for the header to cover any following code again...  I couldn't find a fix for this so removed the fixed header positioning. The user could also have a larger text size set in their browser which could also mess things up with a fixed header containing text. Is there a solution to this problem?
